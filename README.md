# TicketingFunction_Python
Write a program that allows a company to sell 10 tickets. A buyer can buy no more than 5 tickets in each transaction. The program should track the total number of tickets left. The program only terminates when there are no more tickets left. At the end, the number of transactions should be listed. 


Sample Output:

We have 10 tickets. How many do you want to buy ?
